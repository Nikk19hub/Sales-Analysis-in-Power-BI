 This project is based on analyzing product sales using different kinds of charts to predict future growth in product. 
 I have learned about creating dashboards in Power BI. 
➡️Firstly started by loading data then transforming it and cleaning the data. 
➡️ Performing data modeling operations, like connecting tables with each other.
➡️ Performing DAX calculations to create calculated columns.This is really important part of Power BI dash boarding.
➡️At last comes the visualization part where we create different types of graphs(KPI Cards, charts, Matrix etc.) to make our dashboard intuitive, also applying effects. 
➡️There are many different types of graphs for finding new trends in the charts(forecasting).
➡️Creating world map chart tells us about maximum impactful region among the others.
